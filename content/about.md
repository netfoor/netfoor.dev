Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Fortino Romero, a Cloud & DevOps enthusiast with a strong focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, and Linux. Founder and leader of the first AWS User Group in Puebla, I am passionate about building cloud-native solutions and optimizing infrastructure through automation and scalability.

I recently had the opportunity to travel to Japan for a training program on emerging technologies, broadening my perspective on innovation and global tech trends. Additionally, I have actively participated in hackathons and technology events, where I enjoy collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to solve real-world challenges.

My expertise lies in Cloud Computing and DevOps, specializing in containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure as code (IaC). I have experience deploying applications using Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, ensuring efficiency and reliability in cloud environments. Currently, I am exploring MLOps, eager to integrate machine learning workflows into scalable cloud architectures.

Beyond the technical side, I am committed to fostering technology communities, organizing events, and sharing knowledge with like-minded individuals. My goal is to drive cloud adoption and innovation while continuously learning and contributing to impactful projects.

If you're passionate about the cloud and emerging tech, let's connect and build the future together! ðŸš€
